## METIS (VG Wort)

This website is participating in the METIS program and uses a tracking pixel for this. METIS is a program run by the german VG Wort to allow online blogs to get a small royalty for publishing posts.

According to this [document](https://www.vgwort.de/fileadmin/pdf/pressemitteilungen/PM_Datenschutz_METIS_051213_.pdf) (German) by the VG Wort, the Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision has ruled the system to be GDPR conform. If you'd like to opt-out anyways, the easiest way is to block the following domain: `vg08.met.vgwort.de`. All of the tracking pixels for my blog are hosted under this domain, but beware, other blogs' pixels may also be hosted under this domain.
