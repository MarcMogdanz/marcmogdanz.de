Nearly half a year ago I made the biggest decision of my life so far. I dropped out of college and moved to Amsterdam.

I'll try my best to keep the post up to date and also add more content as I learn more about how this country works!

# Place to stay

As you can imagine a lot of people from within The Netherlands but also from outside wanna live, work and study here. That's the reason why Amsterdam has one of the most heated housing markets in Europe. Finding a place to stay will probably be the hardest part of settling down here.

_Some general rules which you should follow:_

In Amsterdam and also some other cities in The Netherlands it is [forbidden to share an apartment with more than two people](https://dutchnews.nl/news/2019/12/amsterdam-flat-sharing-rules-start-to-bite-aim-is-to-bring-balance-d66-says/) if they are not related without a permit by the city. So you'll see many apartments advertised with `no registration` and this is especially the case for shared apartments!

Registering at an address is an important and **unskippable** step for getting your BSN and is needed if you want to stay here. **So make sure you can register at your address!** You should also check with your landlord that the previous renter will deregister or has already deregistered from your address because until they deregistered they will still count towards the maximum of two people per apartment limit.

You should also keep in mind that many people are willing to overbid. So seeing apartments you're able to afford does not automatically mean you'll get them as many are more than happy to just offer to pay more rent if they get the apartment. I've heard some stories of my friends where people just blatantly offered 20% more per month just to get the apartment.

If you can't find an apartment within Amsterdam, you should also consider moving outside or also to another city. Public transportation is quite good in The Netherlands and you can definitely stay in a city like Utrecht which is around 50km from Amsterdam and commute by train. It may not be a long term solution for you, but you should still consider it because it's easier to get an apartment once you're in The Netherlands vs. from abroad.

Last but not least, if money isn't an issue for you: Get a real estate agent to find you an apartment. Many apartments will never be posted online because some agent will already have ten people in line who want it.

## Own apartment

Your own apartment is probably the preferred type of place to stay but obviously also the hardest to get. In general a one room apartment or studio will be harder to get than a bigger apartment as the demand is just higher.

The two biggest sites in The Netherlands to find apartments are [pararius](https://pararius.com/apartments/amsterdam) and [funda](https://www.funda.nl/en/huur/amsterdam/). Both of them are really good and listings there are in general made by the landlords themselves or real estate agents and are of high quality.

## Shared apartment

Sharing an apartment is a good way of saving money and getting to know people but you're also competing with a **bunch more people**.

The cheapest way to find shared apartments is probably via Facebook groups. There are a lot of them and also dedicated ones for expats/students, but beware there are also a lot of scammers as it tends they are sometimes not well moderated.

Otherwise there are a bunch of sites like pararius and funda but where your for example the roommates will put up the listings. The weird part and some would call it the exploitation part is: on most sites you as a potential renter have to pay to be able to send messages/contact the listing owner.

**[Kamernet](https://kamernet.nl/en):** good amount of listings, but rather expensive (15 days for 26 Euro, 1 month for 34 Euro and 3 months for 68 Euro)  
**[kamer.nl](https://kamer.nl/en):** good amount of listings, need to pay (1 month for 25 Euro)  
**[HousingAnywhere](https://housinganywhere.com/):** okayish amount of listings, also rather expensive (2 weeks for 26 Euro, 1 month for 34 Euro and 3 months for 68 Euro)  
**[Just Landed](https://housing.justlanded.com/en/Netherlands/Flatshare):** free, but mostly imports listings from other sites

As always, [YMMV](https://urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ymmv) and a search on your own won't hurt. But keep in mind, most of the plans above are **recurring subscriptions** which you should cancel asap.

Most of the platforms allow you to create alerts, even if you aren't paying. Create an alert with the basic data like square meters, city but nothing really more. This way you'll get slightly more alerts than there are relevant for you but you'll catch listings which didn't trigger certain criterias because of bugs etc. From my experience there were like 5-15 alerts per day on kamernet. Also if you're using emails for your alerts, make sure you check them multiple times a day. Listing are not very long on the platforms and especially good ones are in high demand, ideally you have some sort of **introduction text about yourself copy/paste ready in a note/document** so you can respond asap.

## Hotels

Hotels are fucking expensive. They should only be an option for you in a worst case scenario or if for example your company pays.

If you're already in The Netherlands it may be cheaper to check local hotels for long term deals by visiting or calling them. Some hotels also offer registration on a long term deal.

Probably doesn't matter if you're considering staying in an hotel, but Amsterdam charges 7% and 3 Euro per person per night [tourist tax](<https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/municipal-taxes/tourist-tax-(toeristenbelasting)/>).

## AirBnB

AirBnB and similar sites are not really liked here because they take "normal" apartments from the local population and offer them for a much higher price to tourists.

The city is also going down hard on them and there are a [lot of rules](https://www.amsterdam.nl/veelgevraagd/?caseid=%7BDB74D98B-5515-4205-AB86-8AE634DD89E6%7D) which need to be met to be allowed to rent out on AirBnB, for example you're only allowed to rent out on AirBnB for a max of 30 days per year.

# Insurances

## Health insurance

Everybody living or working in The Netherlands is required to have health insurance. If you've just moved here you have around **four months** to get your Dutch health insurance setup.

In The Netherlands the employee needs to pay their health insurance themselves so you'll pay your premium from your _net salary_. Some other countries, like Germany, have a system in place where the employer pays your health insurance from your _gross salary_. This is **not** the case here, so keep in mind your net salary is exclusive of your health insurance premium.

The price of your health insurance consists of two parts, your premium _(premie)_ and your copay _(eigen risico)_. You'll pay your premium each month but some health insurance companies also offer you to pay it every 3, 6 or 12 months for a small discount. The copay works basically in a "you have to pay a maximum of your copay per year" yourself. The minimum copay for 2022 is 385 Euro, so if your medicine/therapy costs 500 Euro, you'll have to pay 385 Euro yourself and the remaining 115 Euro and everything above that will be covered for the rest of the calendar year. Some health insurance companies allow you to set a higher copay and offer you a lower premium which may be beneficial if you're healthy and/or don't take use of your health insurance. Children are covered by their parents health insurance and have no own premium/copay.

Small note, you'll have to pay for your health insurance retroactive beginning from the date of your registration, not when you actually took the insurance policy. Best to keep money aside each month until you've figured it out so you're not getting hit with a surprise bill.

Most of the health insurance policies are not that different but you'll have two ways to find your ideal policy: You can checkout [each of them one by one](https://www.zorgverzekering.org/eng/insurance-companies/). Or you can use a search engine like [zorgwijzer](https://www.zorgwijzer.nl/zorgvergelijker/english#/search) or [independer](https://www.independer.nl/zorgverzekering/intro.aspx).

In general what is being paid, how much, where etc. are all rather specific questions and you should research for yourself, especially if you already need medicine.

More info can be found on the [iamexpat.nl](https://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-info/insurances-netherlands/dutch-health-insurance) site.

If you've setup your health insurance it's also good to find a General Practitioners (GP) near you so you can register with them and have somebody you can talk to if you have questions. You'll also need to get a referral from your GP each time you need to see a specialist.

In case you're from a digital stone age country like Germany where you still need to have your [blue health insurance card](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=653&langId=en) in order to see a doctor: you don't need it here. It's called a _Zorgpas_ and most health insurance companies provide you with a digital version in their app/on their website. If you're at a doctor it's enough to provide you with your BSN and say that you have Dutch health insurance. Most companies also issue physical cards if you ask them for example when you're traveling within the EU.

Last but not least, you're only allowed to switch your health insurance company once a year and you'll need to do so prior to the 1st of January. An exception is when you just moved to The Netherlands then you're obviously allowed to get one immediately.

## Home insurance

You're not legally required to take home insurance but in my opinion it's a good tradeoff to a pay a small amount each month but in case you (or nature) fucks something up, you're covered and in my opinion it's worth my peace of mind.

There are also some landlords who require the renter to take out home insurance by a clause in the rental contract, so check your contract if that's the case for you. It may also be required/relevant for you if you want to buy a property here on a mortgage.

Personally I'm using [Lemonade](https://www.lemonade.com/nl/en/) because their app/website are both available fully in English, their [policy is open source](https://www.lemonade.com/nl/en/policy-two) and the same for everybody and they offer a combined home insurance and personal liability insurance. I'm paying around 6 Euro a month for both which in my books is a good deal.

You can find a list of more companies offering home insurance over on the [expatica.com](https://www.expatica.com/nl/finance/insurance/home-insurance-in-the-netherlands-132194/#companies) site.

Small note, if you're living in a shared apartment and/or are not [officially married/in an registered partnership](https://www.government.nl/topics/marriage-cohabitation-agreement-registered-partnership/marriage-registered-partnership-and-cohabitation-agreements) you may need to take out these insurances for each of you separately, also if you're living in the same apartment.

## Personal liability insurance

Pretty much the same goes for this one as for the [home insurance](#home-insurance). You're not required to take it but in my opinion it's a small amount of money which gives you peace of mind. There's a good [blog post by Lemonde](https://www.lemonade.com/nl/blog/liability-insurance-netherlands/) explaining the benefits of it but as always, you'll need to decide for yourself.
