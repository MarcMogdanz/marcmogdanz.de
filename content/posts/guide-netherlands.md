Nearly half a year ago I made the biggest decision of my life so far. I dropped out of college and moved to Amsterdam.

I'll try my best to keep the post up to date and also add more content as I learn more about how this country works!

# Place to stay

As you can imagine a lot of people from within The Netherlands but also from outside wanna live, work and study here. That's the reason why Amsterdam has one of the most heated housing markets in Europe. Finding a place to stay will probably be the hardest part of settling down here.

_Some general rules which you should follow:_

In Amsterdam and also some other cities in The Netherlands it is [forbidden to share an apartment with more than two people](https://dutchnews.nl/news/2019/12/amsterdam-flat-sharing-rules-start-to-bite-aim-is-to-bring-balance-d66-says/) if they are not related without a permit by the city. So you'll see many apartments advertised with `no registration` and this is especially the case for shared apartments!

Registering at an address is an important and **unskippable** step for getting your BSN and is needed if you want to stay here. **So make sure you can register at your address!** You should also check with your landlord that the previous renter will deregister or has already deregistered from your address because until they deregistered they will still count towards the maximum of two people per apartment limit.

You should also keep in mind that many people are willing to overbid. So seeing apartments you're able to afford does not automatically mean you'll get them as many are more than happy to just offer to pay more rent if they get the apartment. I've heard some stories of my friends where people just blatantly offered 20% more per month just to get the apartment.

If you can't find an apartment within Amsterdam, you should also consider moving outside or also to another city. Public transportation is quite good in The Netherlands and you can definitely stay in a city like Utrecht which is around 50km from Amsterdam and commute by train. It may not be a long term solution for you, but you should still consider it because it's easier to get an apartment once you're in The Netherlands vs. from abroad.

Last but not least, if money isn't an issue for you: Get a real estate agent to find you an apartment. Many apartments will never be posted online because some agent will already have ten people in line who want it.

## Own apartment

Your own apartment is probably the preferred type of place to stay but obviously also the hardest to get. In general a one room apartment or studio will be harder to get than a bigger apartment as the demand is just higher.

The two biggest sites in The Netherlands to find apartments are [pararius](https://pararius.com/apartments/amsterdam) and [funda](https://www.funda.nl/en/huur/amsterdam/). Both of them are really good and listings there are in general made by the landlords themselves or real estate agents and are of high quality.

## Shared apartment

Sharing an apartment is a good way of saving money and getting to know people but you're also competing with a **bunch more people**.

The cheapest way to find shared apartments is probably via Facebook groups. There are a lot of them and also dedicated ones for expats/students, but beware there are also a lot of scammers as it tends they are sometimes not well moderated.

Otherwise there are a bunch of sites like pararius and funda but where your for example the roommates will put up the listings. The weird part and some would call it the exploitation part is: on most sites you as a potential renter have to pay to be able to send messages/contact the listing owner.

**[Kamernet](https://kamernet.nl/en):** good amount of listings, but rather expensive (15 days for 26 Euro, 1 month for 34 Euro and 3 months for 68 Euro)  
**[kamer.nl](https://kamer.nl/en):** good amount of listings, need to pay (1 month for 25 Euro)  
**[HousingAnywhere](https://housinganywhere.com/):** okayish amount of listings, also rather expensive (2 weeks for 26 Euro, 1 month for 34 Euro and 3 months for 68 Euro)  
**[Just Landed](https://housing.justlanded.com/en/Netherlands/Flatshare):** free, but mostly imports listings from other sites

As always, [YMMV](https://urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ymmv) and a search on your own won't hurt. But keep in mind, most of the plans above are **recurring subscriptions** which you should cancel asap.

Most of the platforms allow you to create alerts, even if you aren't paying. Create an alert with the basic data like square meters, city but nothing really more. This way you'll get slightly more alerts than there are relevant for you but you'll catch listings which didn't trigger certain criterias because of bugs etc. From my experience there were like 5-15 alerts per day on kamernet. Also if you're using emails for your alerts, make sure you check them multiple times a day. Listing are not very long on the platforms and especially good ones are in high demand, ideally you have some sort of **introduction text about yourself copy/paste ready in a note/document** so you can respond asap.

## Hotels

Hotels are fucking expensive. They should only be an option for you in a worst case scenario or if for example your company pays.

If you're already in The Netherlands it may be cheaper to check local hotels for long term deals by visiting or calling them. Some hotels also offer registration on a long term deal.

Probably doesn't matter if you're considering staying in an hotel, but Amsterdam charges 7% and 3 Euro per person per night [tourist tax](<https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/municipal-taxes/tourist-tax-(toeristenbelasting)/>).

## AirBnB

AirBnB and similar sites are not really liked here because they take "normal" apartments from the local population and offer them for a much higher price to tourists.

The city is also going down hard on them and there are a [lot of rules](https://www.amsterdam.nl/veelgevraagd/?caseid=%7BDB74D98B-5515-4205-AB86-8AE634DD89E6%7D) which need to be met to be allowed to rent out on AirBnB, for example you're only allowed to rent out on AirBnB for a max of 30 days per year.
