      III. Information about the data processing

    <p>
      Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as

      of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or
      unless otherwise stipulated below.

    <h5 className="title is-5 margin-10">Server data</h5>
    <p>
      For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to
      us or to our server provider will be collected, especially to ensure a
      secure and stable website: These server log files record the type and
      version of your browser, operating system, the website from which you came
      (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited, the date and time of
      your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our site.
    </p>
    <p className="margin-10">
      The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association
      with any other of your data.
    </p>
    <p className="margin-10">
      The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate
      interest lies in the improvement, stability, functionality, and security
      of our website.
    </p>
    <p className="margin-10">
      The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued
      storage is required for evidentiary purposes. In which case, all or part
      of the data will be excluded from deletion until the investigation of the
      relevant incident is finally resolved.
    </p>

    <h5 className="title is-5 margin-10">Cookies</h5>
    <h6 className="title is-6">a) Session cookies</h6>
    <p>
      We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other
      storage technologies stored on your computer by your browser. These
      cookies process certain specific information about you, such as your
      browser, location data, or IP address. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p className="margin-10">
      This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and
      secure, allowing us, for example, to display our website in different
      languages or to offer a shopping cart function.
    </p>
    <p className="margin-10">
      The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR,
      insofar as these cookies are used to collect data to initiate or process
      contractual relationships.
    </p>
    <p className="margin-10">
      If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our
      legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our website.
      The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.
    </p>
    <p className="margin-10">
      When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.

    <h6 className="title is-6 margin-10">b) Third-party cookies</h6>
    <p>
      If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with whom we
      cooperate for the purpose of advertising, analyzing, or improving the
      features of our website.

      Please refer to the following information for details, in particular for
      the legal basis and purpose of such third-party collection and processing
      of data collected through cookies.
    </p>
    <h6 className="title is-6 margin-10">c) Disabling cookies</h6>
    <p>
      You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your
      browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to delete cookies that have
      already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary,
      depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please use
      the help function or consult the documentation for your browser or contact
      its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent so-called flash
      cookies from being set. Instead, you will need to change the setting of
      your Flash player. The steps and measures required for this also depend on
      the Flash player you are using. If you have any questions, please use the
      help function or consult the documentation for your Flash player or
      contact its maker for support.

      there is no further legal obligation to store your data, such as if an
      order or contract resulted therefrom.
